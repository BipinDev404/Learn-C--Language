# 💻 C Programming Language – Introduction

## 📚 **What is C?**
C is a **general-purpose, procedural programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972** at Bell Labs.  
It is widely used for:
- System programming (Operating Systems like Linux).
- Embedded systems.
- Developing compilers and interpreters.
- Game development.
- Real-time applications.

## 🚀 **Key Features of C**
- **Simple and Efficient:** C offers basic syntax and powerful low-level features.
- **Fast Execution:** C programs are compiled into machine code, making them fast.
- **Portability:** C code can be run on different platforms with minimal changes.
- **Modularity:** Supports functions and libraries for reusability.
- **Memory Management:** C provides direct access to memory using pointers.
- **Low-level Programming:** Allows manipulation of hardware through pointers and memory addresses.

## 🔥 **Why Learn C?**
1. **Foundation for Programming:** Many modern languages (C++, Java, Python) are influenced by C.
2. **Efficient and Fast:** Ideal for performance-critical applications.
3. **Widely Used in Industry:** Essential for system programming and embedded systems.
4. **Teaches Core Programming Concepts:** Understanding C helps in learning data structures, memory management, and algorithms.

## 🛠️ **C Program Structure**
A basic C program includes:
- **Preprocessor Directives:** Includes necessary libraries.
- **Main Function:** The entry point of execution.
- **Statements:** Code logic written inside the main function.
- **Return Statement:** Ends the program and returns a value.

## 📝 **Sample C Program**
```c
#include <stdio.h>    // Include standard input-output library

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");   // Print a message
    return 0;                     // Exit the program
}
